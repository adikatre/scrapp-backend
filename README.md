Next steps:
1. Add the ability to load the saved dataset then upload an image for the model to make a prediction
2. Test the current model on images taken from my phone's camera
3. If it doesn't work accurately, increase the image sizes to 256x256 before training
4. #1 and #2 doesn't work, use this dataset, either by adding it to the current data or creating a separate model: [Garbage Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2/data)
