**OLD**
Next steps:
1. Add the ability to load the saved dataset then upload an image for the model to make a prediction in recyclable_model.ipynb
2. Test the current model on images taken from my phone's camera
3. If it doesn't work accurately, add more convolutional layers or increase the image quality to 256x256 for training
4. #1 and #2 doesn't work, use this dataset, either by adding it to the current data or creating a separate model: [Garbage Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2/data)
